okay lets go for it, create the action plan the overall structure, the requirements.txt, setup environments (if we need multiple go for it idk how it works in python for dev/release environments and stuff) create the skeleton files with docstrings Test imports work. Do overthink and be vigillant for what libraries, what structure and methodology we use to build on here as it will be crucial in the overall success of the thing.
