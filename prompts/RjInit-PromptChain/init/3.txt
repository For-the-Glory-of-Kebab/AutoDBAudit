HISTORICAL PROMPT – Early discussion (2025-11)
Superseded by: Project_Overview.md, implementation_plan.md, architecture_snapshot.md
================================================================================

i need you to do something for me. as we think about the project  and it's structure and we delve into the implementation, our decisions may slightly adapt like changing the structure a bit, having some modules separated or for example the SqlTargets.json schema, or the audit_config.json schema you've proposed.
in the setting you're suggesting for example minimum sql server version, requiring complex passwords etc. we might want to add to these or  evolve them as we approach the final product.
also some of these might be needed to be enforced on a databse level so it would optionally go in the SqlTargets.json for each of them. 
even other decisions, my point being, in the project satement and goal document don't do "Rigid" well-defined boxes that would annoy us in the future. have suggestions but mention that these may / should evolve and mature based on both my intelligence and assesment and the AI's suggestion and intelligence in the scope of the proejct, as we approach implementing it and going forward! I may go hey it'd be better if we included said flag and have option A and B run separately or sheets to contain "X" as well, you might suggest, its better to for example, follow this pattern, architecture, etc. now as the scope of the project, this would help in the development and future minimal adaptations. you dig?
i need this to be reflected in the Project Definition Document.
