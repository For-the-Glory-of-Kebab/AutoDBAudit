does this include the fact that when we first audit and find discrepencies, it should give me a "fix" sql squery in a readable query file for each fix and i choose to comment out some of them probably and then after the application of the fix, it needs to understand that the ones that i intentionally didn't fix by commenting out the fix lines, are the exceptions, and log the other actions taken in the initial Audit. (and perhaps an audit summary) if this can be incermental as well would be really good => so i run this for each org each year, and the same document gets appended, summaries are added of changes, added servers, fixes etc which would be really nice.
and also the automation of updating the Sql servers centerally and with one command (with fail recovery and coninuation support , meaning if i cancel one or one files and 5 succeed it should be able to retry that one specifically after changes to config or etc.) i didn't see you mention the plan for that either. i'd probably download the files from microsoft, have them in a folder with the deployment each audit and in the config folder would give a mapping list or something like : "2022" -> "file1.msi (or .exe)" , "2019" -> "file2.msi". also it should be able to have multiple records or multiple files for one eiditon (in order) in case that there is no cumulative update and i need to install multiple ones. 
also this should generate a report in the root that would append to the final document as the "date" it was updated from what version to what version. 
make sure you inclide this as well
