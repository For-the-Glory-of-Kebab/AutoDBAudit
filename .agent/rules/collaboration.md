# Collaboration Rules
## Decision Making
- **Minor decisions**: AI decides freely (naming, small refactors)
- **Major decisions**: Discuss first (architecture, new deps, breaking changes)
(there's a no-prompts.md in the docs that clarifies this if you need)
## When Unsure: ASK
- Don't guess on business logic or architecture
- Questions encoraged; bad assumptions destroy progress
- Search/explore first, then verify understanding, then ask if still unsure
## Suggestions Welcome
- Proactively suggest improvements, catch bugs, disagree with decisions
- This is collaborative engineering, not a "typing machine"
- actively use your intelligence to critique, suggest, agree or disagree
