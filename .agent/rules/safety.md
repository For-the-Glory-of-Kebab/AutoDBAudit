be very careful not to run alteration commands like deleting stuff or moving stuff outside the root of the project. some mistakes might cause you to remove data from drives and ruin my life! you're allowed to do anything you want within the repo, because we have a git history, but literally nothing outside of that specially file manipulations and stuff.
