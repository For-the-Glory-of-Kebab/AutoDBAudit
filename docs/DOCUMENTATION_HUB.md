# AutoDBAudit Documentation Hub

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **AutoDBAudit** project.
This documentation is structured to be the **Single Source of Truth** for all functionalities, schemas, and workflows.

> NOTE: For the upcoming rewrite these documents are the authoritative, spec-first source for design decisions. Treat them as the canonical documentation during the rewrite; implementation may lag behind.

> **Navigation Tip**: Start here and follow the links to deep-dive sections.

## � [Excel Interface](excel/reference.md)

The core input/output of the application. The Excel Report serves as a bidirectional data entry interface.

* **[Excel Visual Reference](excel/reference.md)**: Defines Colors, Icons (`⏳, ✅, ❌`), Fonts, and valid `Status` enum values.
* **[Sheet Specifications](excel/spec_definitions.md)**: **The Ground Truth**. Detailed schema for EVERY sheet (Key Columns, Editable Columns, Entity Types).
* **[System Overview](excel/README.md)**: Conceptual guide to the "Excel as Database" model (UUIDs, Legacy Keys).

## 🔄 [Sync Engine](sync/logic.md)

The heart of the "Persistent Audit". Reconciles *User Truth* (Excel) with *System Truth* (Database).

* **[Sync Logic Internal Flow](sync/logic.md)**: Precise, phase-by-phase breakdown of `sync_service.py` (Pre-flight -> Read Anno -> Re-audit -> Diff...).
* **[Annotation System](sync/annotations.md)**: How "Justifications" and "Review Status" drives compliance.

## 🛠️ [Remediation Engine](remediation/engine_internals.md)

Generates T-SQL and PowerShell scripts to fix detected issues.

* **[Engine Internals](remediation/engine_internals.md)**: Deep dive into R1-R6 requirements, Hybrid Architecture (TSQL+PS), and Template variables.
* **[Usage Guide](remediation/README.md)**: Explanation of Aggressiveness Levels and Safety.

## 💾 [Data & Architecture](database/schema_comprehensive.md)

* **[Architecture Standards](architecture/standards.md)**: **Must Read**. The "Uncompromisable Standards" for Modern OOP, Resilience, and Performance.
* **[Database Schema](database/schema_comprehensive.md)**: Detailed SQLite tables (`findings`, `row_annotations`), relationships, and the UUID system.
* **[High-Level Overview](architecture/overview.md)**: The Domain-Driven Design (DDD) layering strategy.

## ⌨️ [CLI Reference](cli/reference.md)

* **[Command Manual](cli/reference.md)**: Exhaustive reference for every command (`audit`, `sync`, `remediate`, etc.) and argument.

## � Design Decisions (ADRs)

* **ADRs**: Design decision records are in `docs/adrs/` — use them to understand historical choices (UUIDs, Sync semantics, Remediation policy, Agent governance).

## �📊 [Status & Validation](GAP_ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

* **[Gap Analysis Report](GAP_ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)**: Critical analysis of current implementation vs. standards, with refactoring recommendations.

## 🤖 [AgentStuff](AgentStuff/)

* **[Progress Hub](AgentStuff/)**: Persistent tracking of sessions, decisions, and backlog for project continuity.
