# Project Status: AutoDBAudit

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17
**Current Phase:** Stabilization & Robustness (Sync Logic)

## 📌 Executive Summary
The Sync/Remediation logic (`--sync`) is functional but has edge cases with Excel data reading (Key Collisions) and Configuration gaps. Core infrastructure (CLI, Reports, DB Persistence) is solid.

## 🚧 Active Modules
*   **Sync Service:** Stabilizing. Fixed infinite loops and path syntax errors.
*   **Excel Interface:** Improved date handling and styling.
*   **Annotation Sync:** **NEEDS ATTENTION**. Missing config for "Services" and Key Collision issues on "Backups".

## 🐛 Known Issues (See SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-12-17.md for details)
1.  **Services Sheet Ignored:** Missing from `SHEET_ANNOTATION_CONFIG`.
2.  **Backup Exceptions Mismatch:** Key collision likely.
3.  **Redundant Output Files:** cluttering root output folder.

## ✅ Recent Wins
*   **Action Log:** Persistence verified. Syntax errors fixed.
*   **SA Accounts:** Key collision resolved.
*   **CLI:** Improved reporting aesthetics and clarity.
*   **Performance:** Fixed infinite loop in sync process.

## 📅 Immediate Roadmap
1.  Add `Services` to annotation config.
2.  Refine `Backups` unique key.
3.  Implement cleaner output directory structure for sync runs.
