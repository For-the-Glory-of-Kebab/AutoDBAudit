HISTORICAL PROMPT – Initial brainstorming (2025-11)
Superseded by: Project_Overview.md, implementation_plan.md, architecture_snapshot.md
================================================================================

@db-requirements.md  as you can see in this requirements doc, the scripts and stuff that you can find in "1-report-and-setup" subdirectories was used in order to set up, completely standalone on an offline machine (with all requirements even powershell setup included), restore all runtime dependencies, then run the powershell scripts to achieve a comprehensive audit about what we want to do in a well formatted excel document. 
now in the next day or few i need to rapidly expand this to be more usable ( not a one time thing that works for one specific case ) across various organizations that have this specific requirement audits for their sql server, and generate a well formatted Excel document about it. 
the second important part of it is that i want, based on the audit for it to suggest a script that remedies all of the discrepancies ( seperated so i can comment out acceptable exceptions ).
that script could then generate a "important action taken report" so i can add it or it automatically adds it to the Audit / documentation files.
there are a few very important requirements here, it should be absolutely self contained, the setup, exectuion, everything. once i get this to go use in target orgs, there is no internet access, no fixes no nothing, just a raw windows machine and it should completely run there. 
we don't want a god-tier app with the best most scalable and professional / performant architecture. our time here is limited so agility is #no 1, then readability and adaptability to small changes to the requirements that most likely won't come in the futrue.

other flexible points of it should be it takes variables, as i've done in the @1-Report-and-Setup/main  folder, in the SqlTargets.json, to determine all sql servers, their credentials so i can change them based on the target org and where it's running. 
then i need a another easily configurable part about it as well, which is the generalities of current audit, like the name of the organization, year of the specific audit, some variables like verbosity and other settings that we'd deem necessary and anything else that affects both the audit report and the actions.
its also important that the ouput excel is very very well formatted, with colors, boundaries, cell sizes, alignments even icons, sheet names etc. are very good, and the running of the app should have the option to both generate a new report or just fix the previously generated one, after running discrepancy scripts and fixing them, by understanding which ones where made exceptional, which ones were fixed, and log of actions taken.
of all the checklist items of the project in the file, one other thing would be nice to be able to be robustly automated, each sql server on audits generally has a hotfix or update or a few that i download and take to be installed. remoting in each server and doing this manually is extremely annoying and boring. can this be centrally automated and give verbose logs and realtime stats of how its going. this can be a totally separate module of the app.

so if we understand the general purpose and mission statement of the project, we can move on to analyzing what tech stack, including deployment method, language and runtime and libraries and methodology best suits our needs here. it can be the extension of our powershell and queries here but it also can be an adaptation or just from the ground up. i don't think powershell alone would serve well as the core language and logic home of the project as it doesn't seem to project-ify very well (unless i don't know about modern  languages and features).so is info here enough ? we need to clarify other stuff? if we're ready lets pick our toolset and goals and get started fast!
