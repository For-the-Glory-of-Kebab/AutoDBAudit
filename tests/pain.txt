notes for later (but musts in the end of the ship #no 1):

- the --apply-remediation default paths are incorrect!
- the empty "runs" folder is still getting created in the output directory.
- apply remediation on the latest aggressiveness, didn't fix the SA issue of Renaming and disabling SA !
- remediations also are not handling the Login audit fix! which should be a thing in all aggressiveness levels.
- the higher aggressiveness levels were supposed to go for user breaking stuff but they don't  ( the only thing that should be marked and preserved no matter what is the "conneting user"  => avoid lockout).
- **generally** we need to zoom out and go over our Remediation strategy once again, the Aggressiveness stuff, the application, the way that they're generated and the more important unimplemented part of it which is, the generation of self-contained scripts (maybe ps?!) to do OS level stuff like service or client protocol configurations , or restarting of the services to make stuff take effect we cannot do via tsql!
then we will see if we have enough time to automate a GPO based strategy on our server list that allows PSRemoting then automatically runs the stuff, then reverts the permissions !
- the action sheet, stylistically needs a lot of work. we can talk about merges later, but the color for all change types and stuff seems the same, also the big colmns like findings and category need to have text wrapping applied to them already.
- there are a lot of broken, or just not present commands for the cli. like --apply-fix or etc. clean them up. the rest also need to include better documentation, and accept -h and --help to show help for each specific command.
- as a precautionary measure, check to see if the logic around retrieving data from "merged" cells, isn't broken (empty for subsequent rows) and is consistent everywhere ! it would be much cooler if all the retrieval logic was in a modular maintainable structure that we could make sure works centrally for all fields that are shared like dates, merged stuff and ... => this would mean later, if i want to support some more date formats or add more merged stuff, i don't have to find all the reading logic and adapt them one by one
- other than the cover sheet, the rest of the sheets, need to have a proper non boring font and size declared for their headers and data. it's the default font (i think calibry or smth) and just looks boring.

** a feature of the project was containing a portble small but robust code editor with syntax support for tsql and json config stuff and the rest. one other thing is for it to setup a modern powershell, with possibly a modern terminal like windows terminal and all possible required packages we could need in the machine to do our tasks, fully self contained and offline! so this feature needs to be earmarked to be handled before the first shipment of the app (tomorrow)

? remind me what the discrepancy logic is for us in the Database Users sheet.
