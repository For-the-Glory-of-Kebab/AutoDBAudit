# Sessions Index

How to consume:
- Read the most recent dated file in this folder (YYYY-MM-DD.md) for continuity.
- If resuming after many days, skim prior logs in reverse chronological order.

Update rules:
- Add a new dated file per active day/session.
- Summarize actions, next steps, and lint/test status in each session file.
- Do not edit or delete past session logs.

Recent summaries:
- 2026-01-05: WinRM policy coverage and revert capture; facade/parallel runner; persistence/auth fixes; pyright/pylint clean.
- 2026-01-04: Repo/schema alignment, CREDSSP fix, richer status API, TrustedHosts + target baseline/revert capture, lint/type clean.
- 2025-12-31: PS remoting architecture decisions and initial layer implementations.
- 2025-12-29: AgentStuff setup.
