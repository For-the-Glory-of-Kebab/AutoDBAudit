# Sessions Index

How to consume:
- Read the most recent dated file in this folder (YYYY-MM-DD.md) for continuity.
- If resuming after many days, skim prior logs in reverse chronological order.

Update rules:
- Add a new dated file per active day/session.
- Summarize actions, next steps, and lint/test status in each session file.
- Do not edit or delete past session logs.
