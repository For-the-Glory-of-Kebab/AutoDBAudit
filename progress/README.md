# Progress Tracking Hub

This folder (`progress/`) serves as the persistent, git-tracked repository for session data, project progress, and key decisions.

## Structure

- `sessions/`: Logs for each coding session (auto-generated or manual notes).
- `decisions/`: Key architectural or project decisions.
- `backlog/`: TODOs, issues, and future tasks.

## Usage

- Update files as we work.
- Commit changes regularly for persistence.
- Reference in docs or code as needed.
